# Loan Default Classifier
---
## Abstract
Banks and all sort of credit institutes which provide *loans*, face great challenges when a new potential customer asks for a loan.\
These challenges translate into *risks*, which if not properly balanced, may end up with catastrophic consequences for all clients in the financial-chain, and may have a big impact in the outside world too.\
Technology can mitigate these risks.

By gathering a huge amout of *data*, and by applying some analytics we can see the *hidden shape* of the risks that credit institutes take.\
Then, thanks to some state-of-the-art algorithms we can predict the potential risk that a new client may represent for a bank.\
At the end of the day, the aim is to provide a robust model to support difficult *decision-making* scenarios.

The purpose of the notebook is to show and manipulate a huge dataset collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset), then after some *feature engineering* we apply and compare three State-of-the-Art *ensemble learning* algorithms for tabular data:
- AdaBoost
- GradientBoost
- XGBoost

Based on statistics we decide which the best one is.\
Further conclusions and possible expansions are presented.
